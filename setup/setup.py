#When you enter no location, this will be used to import the images

#The factor will determine, how dark the underlaying image will be
#A lower number means a darker image

#Destination defines the directory, where the final images should be rendered to
#If files already exist, they will be OVERWRITTEN BY THE PROGRAM
